- Hello ðŸ‘‹
- Iâ€™m Alex. I'm currently trying to improve my skill in programming by working on projects. I can currently code in Java and C#, but I want to learn C++ soon. 
- I'm currently interested in game development, but I don't mind working on other projects if people want my help. 
- I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Salford. In my free time, I either try and look for new projects to help out on or I work on current projects I have.
- You can reach me either on discord at X_Dusks_X#2703 or write me an email at alex.mihai.200424@gmail.com. I am looking forward to meeting you. ðŸ‘‹
