- Hello ðŸ‘‹
- Iâ€™m Alex. I'm currently trying to improve my skill in programming by working on projects. My main language C#, but I can also learn other languages if I am given time and a little bit of help. 
- I'm currently interested in game development, but I don't mind working on other projects if people want my help. 
- Iâ€™m going to study computer science at university soon (probably next year) and then try to get a job in the game development industry.
- You can reach me either on discord at X_Dusks_X#2703 or write me an email at alex.mihai.200424@gmail.com. I am looking forward to meeting you. ðŸ‘‹
